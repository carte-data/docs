# Roadmap

* Set up a free OAuth server for authenticating non-Netlify hosted sites
* Have Carte preserve arbitrary metadata added to columns and datasets
* Add a `last processed` parameter to dataset pages that displays the date of the last commit for the file
* Add tagging support
* **Hosted Carte instance with extra features. If you have a need for this, please let me know at balint at hey dot com**
